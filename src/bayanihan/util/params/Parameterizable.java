/**
 * This interface is implemented by classes that take Params objects
 * and use them to determine their own implementation.
 * <p>
 * The following code demonstrates how this might be used:
 * <code>
 * Params p = some Params subclass instance
 * Object o = Util.instantiate("Engine"); // Engine is possibly Parameterizable
 * Params.parameterize( o, p );  // if o is parameterizable, then parameterize
 *                               // using Params p
 * </code>
 * <p>
 * Note that a Parameterizable object is allowed to keep a pointer to the
 * Params instance it is passed.
