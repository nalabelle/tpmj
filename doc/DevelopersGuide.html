<h1>TPM/J Developer's Guide</h1>
</center>

Current version: 0.3.0 (alpha)<br>
 Release date: 3 April 2007<br>
 

<h2>Overview</h2>

TPM/J is an object-oriented API using Java for low-level access to
the TPM. TPM/J is intentionally <em>not</em> compliant with the
TCG's TSS specifications. Its main intent is to provide a flexible
object-oriented API that is more immediately usable by researchers
and programmers for doing experiments and software R&amp;D, in
cases where TCG-compliance is not critical.<br>
 <br>
 TPM/J treats TPM low-level commands (i.e., the commands directly
given to the TPM chip itself) and the response data structures of
these commands as first-class Java objects. This allows programmers
to easily access the fields of the command and response data
structures in an object-oriented way, instead of having to
explicitly read bytes from command-specific offsets in large byte
arrays. Also, because it defines each command and response data
structure as a separate Java class, it allows for a more modular,
rather than monolithic implementation of APIs for each TPM
command.<br>
 <br>
 TPM/J also provides higher-level Java classes that represent
higher-level concepts and constructs such as authorization sessions
and transport sessions. In the case of authorization sessions, for
example, these classes allow a session's state to be kept within a
separate session object, instead of putting the burden on the
programmer to explicitly create and manage local or global
variables for keeping track of such state in his or her own code.
In the case of transport sessions, the object-oriented form of the
TPM commands allows things such as the encryption and logging of
wrapped commands, etc., to be done in a more systematic and modular
way (although full support for encrypted wrapped commands is not
yet available in the current alpha version.)<br>
 <br>
 Finally, access to the TPM itself is abstracted into a TPM driver
object. By providing different platform-specific driver objects for
different platforms, we are able to support multiple platforms
(e.g., Linux and Windows) without requiring the programmer to
change any code. To our knowledge, TPM/J is one of the first
cross-platform APIs for using the TPM, that works in both Windows
and Linux, without requiring the application programmer to write or
compile separate versions.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 

<h2>User's Guide</h2>

To use TPM/J on your system, see the <a href=
"UsersGuide.html">User's Guide</a>.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 

 

<h2>Library and Other settings</h2>

See the <a href="UsersGuide.html#settings">User's Guide</a> for the basic settings.

<p>Note: in addition to the currently-supported platforms, 
it should be relatively straightforward to make TPM work
with any Windows library which provides a TDDL-level interface. For
examples, see the code under <tt>src/.../drivers/win32</tt> and the
<tt>c/IFXTPM</tt> and <tt>c/TBSProxy</tt> directory. If you write
your own driver code, please contact us to contribute them back to
the community. 
</p>

<h2>Working with the Source Code</h2>

The source code is provided in the form of a zipped-up Eclipse
project directory. To start working with it, just unzip it to your
local file system, and import it as a project into your
workspace.<br>
 <br>
 A note on formatting conventions: the TPM/J source code does
<em>not</em> follow standard Java formatting conventions. The most
noticeable differences are the placement of the opening brace "{",
plus a slightly more liberal use of whitespace to improve
readability. For a more detailed explanation of the formatting
conventions used for TPM/J, see Luis Sarmenta's <a href=
"http://people.csail.mit.edu/lfgs/lectures/cs21a/CodeFormat.ppt">lecture
slides</a> on code formatting . The file
SarmentaStyleEclipseCodeFormatterSettings.xml contains Eclipse
formatter settings for roughly following the preferred style. Note,
though, that Eclipse is not always able to follow all the ideal
spacing, line-wrapping, and indentation conventions. In such cases,
sticking with what Eclipse produces is acceptable.<br>
 <br>
 <br>

<h2>High-Level TPM/J programming</h2>

<p>
The best place to start understanding TPM/J and learning to write your
own applications using TPM/J, is to look at the tools classes in
the <tt>tools</tt> package.
</p>

<p>
For the most part, these do <em>not</em> deal directly with TPM commands,
but use the convenience functions in the <tt>funcs</tt> package.
The edu.mit.csail.tpmj.funcs package contains higher-level classes
that make it easier to perform commonly-needed tasks without having
to deal with the TPM command objects directly. To use these, you
generally follow the following steps: 
</p>

<ol>
<li>Initialize the TPMDriver. Note that the TPMUtilityFuncs class
stores the TPMDriver object in a static variable which is
automatically used by the classes in the funcs package.<br>
<pre>
TPMUtilityFuncs.initTPMDriver();
</pre>
</li>

<li>Call the desired function. Note that the output of these
functions are typically the relevant TPM structures themselves, and
<em>not</em> the direct output of the command. 

<pre>
TPM_KEY key = TPMStorageFuncs.TPM_CreateWrapKey(
                parentHandle, parentAuth, keyAuth, migAuth,
                keyUsageType, keyUsageFlags );
System.out.println( "Returned wrapped key: " + key );
</pre>
</li>
<li>At the end of your <em>entire</em> program, call <tt>TPMUtilityFuncs.cleanupTPMDriver();</tt>
This calls the <tt>cleanup()</tt> method on the driver, which on some platforms (i.e., Windows and Vista)
is needed to close the TDDL session/context.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
In addition to these functions, there are also generic utility
classes provided in edu.mit.csail.tpmj.util. In particular,
<tt>CryptoUtil</tt> has several useful functions for doing some
cryptographic computations in software. (Some of these use the
Bouncy Castle library for Java.)  Also, <tt>TPMToolsUtil</tt> has
convenience methods that are used by the tools classes to make
handling command-line options easier.
</p>


<h2>Low-level TPM/J programming: How to Use TPM Command Objects</h2>

<p>
In general, the data structures defined by the <a href=
"https://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/specs/TPM">TCG's Structures
of the TPM spec</a>, are defined as separate Java classes in the
edu.mit.csail.tpmj.structs package. To be consistent with TCG
notation, we have intentionally violated the standard Java naming
conventions, and have named the classes in all caps, according to
their TCG names. The structs package also contains some classes
which do not directly correspond to TCG structures, but which may
represent abstract base classes for TCG classes. These classes are
not named in all caps.</p>

<p>
Similarly, the TPM commands, as defined in the TCG's Commands spec
for the TPM are defined as separate Java classes in the
edu.mit.csail.tpmj.commands package, again following the same names
and capitalization used in the TCG Spec. Additionally, each of
these command classes has a corresponding class that defines its
output response data structure, with the name
&lt;CommandName&gt;Output, where &lt;CommandName&gt; is the name of
the command (e.g., TPM_GetPubKey and TPM_GetPubKeyOutput would be
the Java class files corresponding to the TPM_GetPubKey
command).</p>

 To use an existing command object directly, one follows the
following steps:<br>
 

<ol>
<li>Initialize and get a TPMDriver<br>
<pre>
TPMUtilityFuncs.initTPMDriver();
TPMDriver tpmDriver = TPMUtilityFuncs.getTPMDriver();
</pre>
</li>

<li>Create the command object. 

<pre>
TPM_PCRRead cmd = new TPM_PCRRead( pcrIndex );
</pre>
</li>

<li>Call the command's execute method, giving it the TPMDriver
object, and receiving the output in the appropriate response type. 

<pre>
TPM_PCRReadOutput output = cmd.execute( tpmDriver );
</pre>

<br>
 Note that this command can throw a TPMException, so it should
generally be surrounded by a try-catch. Any errors in executing the
command, including TPM errors with a corresponding return code will
throw a type of TPMException.<br>
</li>

<li>Read and use the output data structure using its fields. 

<pre>
TPM_PCRVALUE pcrVal = output.getOutDigest();
System.out.println( "PCR " + pcrIndex + "= " + pcrVal );
</pre>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Using commands which require authorization is more complicated. For
these, you would need to use one of the authorization session
classes. See <tt>edu.mit.csail.tpmj.tests.TPMAuthTest</tt> for an example.
Note also that there are many "convenience classes" in the
edu.mit.csail.tpmj.funcs package for hiding the complexity of using
authorization sessions directly for commonly-used tasks. <br>
</p>

 

<h2>How to Create Your Own TPM Command Objects</h2>

At present, TPM/J does not yet implement command objects for all
TPM 1.2 ordinals.  However, TPM/J is designed to easily accommodate new
command ordinals in the future. To create support for an
unsupported command, you generally have to follow the following
steps: 

<ol>
<li>Check to see the TPM structures used in the input and output
structures of the command. Create the corresponding Java files for
these in the structs package, as necessary. The key tasks in
defining these class files is writing the fields, the constructor,
the <tt>toBytes</tt> method, and the <tt>fromBytes</tt> method.
Look at the source code in the <tt>structs</tt> package for
examples.</li>

<li>Create the command class under the commands package, under the
same name as given by TCG. It should be descended from TPMCommand
(commands that require authorization should extend one of the
TPMAuth* classes or TPMKeyAuth1Command). Note that TPMCommand
classes are themselves TPMStructs, so you must also define the
toBytes and fromBytes methods to specify how the command is
converted into a byte array.</li>

<li>Create the corresponding &lt;CommandName&gt;Output class. This
should be placed in the commands package (not the structs
package).</li>

<li>Override the <tt>execute(...)</tt> method(s) of the
&lt;CommandName&gt; class to return the appropriate type. e.g., 

<pre>
    @Override
    public TPM_PCRReadOutput execute( TPMDriver tpmDriver ) throws TPMException
    {
        return (TPM_PCRReadOutput) super.execute( tpmDriver );
    }
</pre>
</li>

<li>Also override the <tt>getReturnType()</tt> method of the
&lt;CommandName&gt; class to return the class of the appropriate
type. e.g., 

<pre>
    @Override
    public Class getReturnType()
    {
        return TPM_PCRReadOutput.class;
    }
</pre>
</li>

<li>If desired, add corresponding convenience functions for using
the new command to one of the classes (or a new class) in the funcs
package. These convenience functions should hide the creation of
the TPM command object itself. It should receive the user-level
input data for the command, and return the desired TPM structure.
(Although in cases where the TPM returns several data structures of
interest, it is OK, or even better, to return the entire command
output data structure itself directly.)</li>
</ol>

<p>See the source code in the commands package for examples.</p>

<p>(TODO: More explicit documentation on how to define
ByteArrayables and write toBytes and fromBytes methods. For now,
please look at the examples in the source code.)</p>

<h2>Parameter Handling</h2>

The tools in the <tt>tools</tt> package use
a package for handling command-line parameters
from my (Luis Sarmenta's) thesis project
<a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/lfgs/bayanihan/papers/sarmenta-phd-abstract.html">
Bayanihan</a>.  It provides a convenient way
to handle command-line parameters and switches.
To understand how it works, look
at the source code and the tools package.

<h2>Debugging</h2>

<p>The edu.mit.csail.tpmj.util.Debug class provides debugging
functions in the form of print statements that only print when
debugging for certain classes is on. To use, add Debug.setDebugOn(
MyClass.class, true ) for each class "MyClass" that you want to
debug, at the beginning of the main() method of the main class you
are running. Then, in MyClass, you can use Debug.print( ... ) and
Debug.println( ... ) methods for conditional debugging output. If
debugging has been turned on for MyClass, then these methods will
print to System.out. Otherwise, they won't. See the demos, tools,
and tests classes, and the classes that these debug, for
examples.</p>

<p>Note that the print and println commands accept 
a variable-length argument list of Objects.
The recommended way to use it is to use a comma (',')
instead of string concatenation ('+') when
printing a complex object (e.g., a TPMStruct object)
with a long <tt>toString(...)</tt> method.
This way the call to the <tt>toString</tt>
of the object is delayed until 
within the method itself, and only happens if
debugging is on.  This can save a significant
amount of time when debugging is off.
</p>

For example,
<br>
The following:
<pre>
Debug.println( "output = ", outputStruct );
</pre>
is better than:
<pre>
Debug.println( "output = " + outputStruct );
</pre>
(Note also that byte array objects
are automatically printed using <tt>ByteArrayUtil.toPrintableHexString(...)</tt>
within the print statement.)

<p>The <tt>main()</tt> method of the <tt>Debug</tt> class has
a demonstration of the performance differences of these two techniques.

<p>For more complex conditional Debug operations, you
can also use an <tt>if</tt> statement with
the <tt>Debug.isDebugOn()</tt> method.
</p>

<p>Finally, most of the tools in the <tt>tools</tt> package support
the /D option, which turns on debugging mode for the tpm driver.
This prints all the input and output bytes to/from the TPM.</p>

<h2>To-Do List<br>
</h2>

<h3>Unresolved/Unexplained problems</h3>
<ul>
<li>On an Intel Mac (with Infineon 1.2 chip), the TPMSeal tool returns a TPM_BAD_PARAMETER error if PCRs are specified.
The same tool has been shown to work on a Broadcom 1.2 chip under Linux, and an Infineon TPM 1.1 chip under Windows XP.</li>
<li>Signing a transport session log with an AIK works on a Broadcom 1.2 chip and an Infineon 1.2 chip (on the Mac),
but fails on the ST Micro TPM 1.2 chip on a Gateway M465E.  Strangely, signing with a non-AIK signing key works on the
ST Micro chip.  (However, signing a transport session log with a non-AIK key is not useful because 
such transport session logs can easily be forged using a TPM_Sign command using the same TPM, and so does not prove
that the commands were actually executed, which is what signed transport session logs are supposed to prove.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Others</h3>
<ol>
<li>Not all TPM commands have corresponding command classes yet.
Continue to implement unimplemented ordinals.</li>

<li>Currently, transport sessions work enough to be usable for
signing monotonic counter operation outputs. (This is the only way
to get non-forgeable signed outputs certifying the value of the
monotonic counters). At present, however, transport sessions do not
fully support encryption. They also do not support all TPM
Commands. (Some ordinals which require special HMAC handling may or
may not work properly right now.)</li>

<li>NVRAM functions are working but not fully tested.</li>

<li>AIK creation creates usable AIKs, but has not been tested with
real privacy CAs.</li>

<li>Javadoc documentation should be cleaned-up and produced.</li>

<li>Some of the examples can be improved or documented better.
There are some tests or main functions in the funcs package, which
can/should eventually be turned into independent tools
classes.</li>
</ol>


<h2><a name="timingdemos">Timing Tests</a></h2>

Use demo.TPMTiming to view a timing report for various TPM
functions. Use <a href="#timecount">tests.TPMCounterTimingTest</a>
to view timing constraints for monotonic counters.<br>
<pre>
java edu.mit.csail.tpmj.tests.TPMTiming &lt;ownerPwd&gt; [srkPwd]
</pre>

 Notes:
 <ul>
 <li>This test will create a test key file in the process.</li>
 <li><b>Warning!</b> This test extends some of the PCRs and may change
 your configuration, and these changes cannot be reversed without rebooting
 your machine.  This may or may not interfere with other
 applications which depend on having a specific PCR configuration (e.g., to seal and unseal data).
 </li>
 <li>For TPM 1.1b chips, some of these demos will fail.</li>
</ul>



<h2><a name="othertests">Other (Old) Tests</a></h2>

<p>The code in the tpmj.tests folder is rough code intended
to test certain features of TPM/J as well as give developers
an idea of ways to use these features at a lower level. 
Note also that some of the classes in the tpmj.funcs folder 
contain their test code in their main() methods.
</p>

<em>(<b>Note:</b>The documentation for these tests
have not been updated since version 0.2.0,
and the tests themselves may not have been fully tested since then.
Some the tests below may not work anymore.)</em></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#auth">Test running TPM commands in OIAP and OSAP
sessions</a></li>

<li><a href="#pcr">Test the PCR quoting functionality of the
TPM</a></li>

<li><a href="#testkey">Test a saved key</a></li>

<li><a href="#counters">Test the functionality of a monotonic
counter</a></li>

<li><a href="#timecount">Test the timing constraints of a monotonic
counter</a></li>

<li><a href="#transport">Test the functionality of the transport
sessions</a></li>
</ul>
 


<h3><a name="auth">Test running TPM commands in OIAP and OSAP sessions</a></h3>

Use tests.TPMAuthTest to test runnning TPM commands in OIAP and OSAP sessions:
<pre>
java edu.mit.csail.tpmj.tests.TPMAuthTest &lt;keyHandle&gt;
</pre>

Arguments:<br>
 - keyHandle - The key handle (in hex) of the key loaded in the TPM
that should be used to perform this test. Defaults to 0x40000000
(SRK).<br>
 <br>
 Notes:<br>
 - The final test ("Trying OIAPSession with wrong secret")
<em>should</em> fail with a TPM_AUTHFAIL<br>


<h3><a name="pcr">Test the PCR quoting functionality of the TPM</a></h3>

Use tests.TPMPcrTest to test the PCR quoting functionality of the TPM: 
<pre>
java edu.mit.csail.tpmj.tests.TPMPcrTest &lt;keyFile&gt; &lt;keyPassword&gt;
</pre>

Arguments:<br>
 - keyFile - A TPM key capable of signing data. This will default
to 'testkey.key'.<br>
 - keyPassword - The password to the specified TPM key. This will
default to 'test'.<br>
 <br>
 Notes:<br>
 - The 'signing' attack mentioned at the end of the test
demonstrates how a non-AIK signing key can be used to both a quote
or TPM sign arbitrary data, producing identical signatures. This
shows that signing a TPM_Quote operation is not secure if a key
other an AIK is used.

<h3><a name="testkey">Test a saved key</a></h3>

Use tests.TPMKeyTest to test a saved .key file generated by
TPMCreateKey or TPMWrapKey: 
<pre>
java edu.mit.csail.tpmj.tests.TPMPcrTest &lt;keyFile&gt; &lt;keyPassword&gt; &lt;parentPassword&gt;
</pre>

Arguments:<br>
 - keyFile - A TPM key capable of signing data. This will default
to 'testkey.key'.<br>
 - keyPassword - The password to the specified TPM key. This will
default to (no authorization required).<br>
 - parentPassword - The password of the parent key for loading the
key.&nbsp; This will default to all-zeros or no authorization.<br>
 <br>
 Notes:<br>
 - The tests done here are similar to those done in TPMCreateKey
and TPMWrapKey but work on an existing key (without creating a new
one).<br>
 - If keyFile has a corresponding .ser file, it will be loaded and
deserialized as an RSA keypair.&nbsp; The crypto operations would
then be done both in software and using the TPM, and the results
compared.<br>

<h3><a name="counters">Test the functionality of a monotonic counter</a></h3>

Use tests.TPMCounterTest to test the functionality of the TPM's
monotonic counters:
<pre>
java edu.mit.csail.tpmj.tests.TPMCounterTest &lt;counterID&gt;
</pre>

Arguments:<br>
 - counterID - The monotonic counter that should be used in this
test.<br>
 <br>
 Notes:<br>
 - Only one monotonic counter on the TPM can be incremented per
reboot. If any other monotonic counters have been incremented since
the last reboot, this test will fail.<br>

<h3><a name="timecount">Test the timing constraints of a monotonic counter</a></h3>

Use tests.TPMCounterTimingTest to test the timing constraints of
the TPM's monotonic counters:<br>
<pre>
java edu.mit.csail.tpmj.tests.TPMCounterTimingTest &lt;counterID&gt;
</pre>

Arguments:<br>
 - counterID - The monotonic counter that should be used in this
test.<br>
 <br>
 Notes:<br>
 - Only one monotonic counter on the TPM can be incremented per
reboot. If any other monotonic counters have been incremented since
the last reboot, this test will fail.<br>
 - This test needs to load a key named 'testaik.key' with password
'test' from the current working directory.<br>
 - This test will take a while, since it performs 100 increments on
the specified counter. <br>


<h3><a name="transport">Test the functionality of the transport sessions</a></h3>

Use tests.TPMTransTest to see how counters can be incremented from
within a transport session in the TPM:<br>
<pre>
java edu.mit.csail.tpmj.tests.TPMTransTest &lt;counterID&gt;
</pre>

Arguments:<br>
 - counterID - The counter that will be used in this transport
session test.<br>
 <br>
 Notes:<br>
 - This test needs to load a key named 'testkey.key' with password
'test' from the current working directory.<br>
 - The specified counter will be incremented during this test.<br>
 - Again, because of the 'signing attack', an AIK should be used
for signing transport sessions logs. Otherwise, an adversary can
easily fake a log and use TPM_Sign to produce the appropriate
signature.<br>
