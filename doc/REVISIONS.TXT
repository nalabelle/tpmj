HISTORY
-------

20070403: TPM/J Alpha 0.3

- Lots of changes and improvements
- Improved cross-platform support:
  - added support for Intel Mac OS X and Windows Vista
  - removed dependence on xFunction for Windows XP
- User-usable command-line tools in tools package
  - not restricted to specific passwords anymore
  - much more comprehensive set of tools
  - added tool for using monotonic counter for "count-stamping" data
- Additional TPM command support
  - TPM_Seal and TPM_Unseal, TPM_FlushSpecific, TPM_LoadKey2, etc.
- Cleaned-up code and APIs for better ease-of-use
- A few bug-fixes
- Improved documentation

Known Issues:
- Vista unloads the key handle after exiting the LoadKey tool, so tools
that take keyHandles as command-line arguments currently do not work
under Vista.  However, writing your own program that loads a key
and uses the key handle within the same program works.
- Sealing data to a PCR configuration doesn't work on an Intel Mac
with an Infineon TPM 1.2 chip.  It works on other chips, though.
It's not clear why.
- Signing a transport session with an AIK doesn't work on
a Gateway M465E with an ST Micro chip 1.2 (under Linux), 
but signing with a non-AIK signing key works.  
We have not confirmed this problem on another ST Micro chip 1.2, though.

Remainding TODOs:
- Implement other commands
- Implement support for encrypted commands and other commands that require
  special HMAC handling in transport sessions.
 

20061212: TPM/J Alpha 0.2
(First packaged version released to public)

- Renamed to TPM/J to avoid confusion with IAIK/OpenTC jTpmTools.
- Changed the way encryption of passwords and computation of HMACs are handled in
  authorization sessions and transport sessions.
- Included binaries for xFunction and win32 driver (see license)
- Included QuickStart documentation

TODO:
- Rewrite code to use JNI directly so xFunction will be unnecessary
- Implement other commands
- Implement support for encrypted commands and other commands that require
  special HMAC handling in transport sessions.


20060822: JTPM version Alpha 0.1.0.0
(First packaged version, released internally at MIT)

- Windows TDDL driver class will not work with xFunction from excelsior.com
  (not included because it is a commercial license)

TODO: 
- rewrite this code to use JNI directly without using xFunction
