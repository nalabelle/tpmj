<h2>
Overview</h2>
<p>
TPM/J is an object-oriented API using Java for low-level access to the TPM. 
It was developed as part of the research project on 
<a href="http://projects.csail.mit.edu/tc/">Trusted Computing at MIT</a>.
</p>
<p>
TPM/J is intentionally <em>not</em> compliant with the TCG's TSS specifications.
Its main intent is to provide a flexible object-oriented API that is more immediately
usable by researchers and programmers for doing experiments and software R&amp;D,
in cases where TCG-compliance is not critical.</p>
<p>
TPM/J treats TPM low-level commands (i.e., the commands directly given to the TPM
chip itself), and the response data structures of these commands, as first-class Java objects. This
allows programmers to easily access the fields of the command and response data
structures in an object-oriented way, instead of having to explicitly read bytes
from command-specific offsets in large byte arrays. Also, because it defines each
command and response data structure as a separate Java class, it allows for a more
modular, rather than monolithic implementation of APIs for each TPM command.</p>
<p>
TPM/J also provides higher-level Java classes that represent higher-level concepts
and constructs such as authorization sessions and transport sessions.  In the
case of authorization sessions, for example, these classes allow a session's state
to be kept within a separate session object, instead of putting the burden on the
programmer to explicitly create and manage local or global variables for keeping
track of such state
in his or her own code.  In the case of transport sessions,
the object-oriented form of the TPM commands allows things such as the encryption
and logging of wrapped commands, etc., to be done in a more systematic and modular
way (although full support for encrypted wrapped commands is not yet available in
the current alpha version.)</p>
<p>
Finally, access to the TPM itself is abstracted into a TPM driver object. By providing
different platform-specific driver objects for different platforms, we are able
to support multiple platforms (e.g., Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, and Vista) without requiring the programmer
to change any code. To our knowledge, TPM/J is one of the first cross-platform
APIs for using the TPM, that works under Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, and Vista without requiring
the application programmer to write or compile separate versions.</p>
